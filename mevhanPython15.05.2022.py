CHANGES:
        DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING !!!
        Including the name of the function or the name of the return values.
        you need to fill the function body so the return is as requested
        This will result in disqualifying the function !!!
COMMENTS:
        DO NOT leave any comments of your own in the file you are turning in
        besides the doc string.

Good Luck
